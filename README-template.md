## Overview

### The challenge

- Build out the project to the designs provided

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

When creating a border radius on the parent element, the image or background on the child element may overflow over the parent element and obscure the border radius. In order to fix this, set the `overflow` property of the parent element to `hidden`. This will hide any items which overflow over the parent and therefore, will be able to see the radius on the parent.

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own plans for continued development.**

### Useful resources

- [Stack Overflow - Forcing child to obey parent's curved borders in CSS](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3714862/forcing-child-to-obey-parents-curved-borders-in-css) - This helped me understand why I needed to use `overflow: hidden` on my card element in order to allow for the border radius to show up.
